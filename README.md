# verbose-carnival
messing around with building a website using React and Material-UI

Website now hosted at lguzmanfinn.com as of 1-20-2020!!
- hosted using AWS s3 buckets and Route 53

# TO-DO
- add 404 error page
- get actual images instead of filler
- clean up projects (since none are actually made yet)
    - Add info on projects pages on what I want/plan to do, get rid of unmade project cards on home page
- at skeleton images
- properly center skills icons when on mobile
- fix project card links

# KNOWN BUGS
- home page glitches when rendered, may have to do with image load time?
- drawer acting weird on mobile when opened over an image
- page width bigger than actual page width so can scroll side to side
